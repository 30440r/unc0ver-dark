# Sileo Binary Redistribution License
Sileo is (C) 2019, the Sileo Project

Sileo's source code is confidential and proprietary. It may not be read, copied or distributed without explicit permission of CoolStar. This license does not grant permission to use the Source code.

Sileo binaries must be distributed free of charge, but are still copyrighted and may not be mirrored or cloned without permission from CoolStar

# Sileo Binary Redistribution Grant
This addendum grants official permission to "Shady" (also known as nqcshady on github) and "Diatrus" (also known as Diatrus on github) to redistribute Sileo 1.1.0 or higher and its dependencies as part of a jailbreak bootstrap, granted the following conditions are met.

### Modifications to Sileo and its dependencies
Redistributors are not allowed to modify packages required by Sileo that are distributed under the Sileo license. These packages must be redistributed in their unmodified form, and clones may not be used.

### Paired dependencies
A Sileo version is paired with a certain version of APT. For example, Sileo 1.0 to 1.2.5 (as of July 28th, 2019) are paired with APT 1.8. When each version of Sileo is released, it is effectively paired with the latest version of APT from the Electra/Chimera repo at the time. Users may mismatch Sileo and APT versions to some extent, however official redistributors are required to distribute the correct paired versions of Sileo and APT together.

### Other dependencies
Sileo may require certain other closed source dependencies such as uikittools-ng. As stated in the previous clauses, redistributors are required to redistribute the official unmodified packages of these dependencies, so long as they are required to run Sileo

### Other software
The official origin repo for Sileo may contain other closed source software under a different license. (E.g. Anemone 3). This license does not provide permission to redistribute the other software. However, the origin repo itself may be added to Sileo so users may continue to download the other software themselves from the origin repo

### Origin repo
The origin repo is defined as the official repository that is run by CoolStar to distribute Sileo. As of July 28, 2019, there are 2 origin repos (the Electra and Chimera repos).

### Credit
For this license to be valid, credit must be provided to the Sileo Team for Sileo itself, as well as credits for any of the required dependencies that are redistributed (e.g. CoolStar for uikittools-ng).

### License
This redistribution grant is only valid when attached with a copy of the Sileo Binary Redistribution license. This grant along with the license must be included with the software distribution package that Sileo is bundled with, along with an official signature.

### Signing
For this redistribution grant to be valid, a base64 encoding of an RSA signature (with SHA2-256 digest) signed with CoolStar's private key must be attached to the end of this license, signing the contents of both the license and the redistribution grant up until the period (.) after the date at the end of the redistribution grant that indicates the date that the license has been signed.

The signature may be validated against the RSA public key at https://gist.github.com/coolstar/a8f4159993be234b24676cb0da5b7dcc to verify that this license is valid.
