### FAQ
* Where can I stay up to date on unc0ver dark? -- [Join the unc0ver dark Discord](https://discord.gg/4pYwBCb)
* Jailbreak isn't working on iOS 11?!! -- Known issue, use either [Electra](https://coolstar.org/electra/) or [unc0ver](https://github.com/pwn20wndstuff/Undecimus/releases)
* My Cydia is crashing? How do I fix this? -- Uninstall CyDown. It is not updated for the new fork of Cydia. Also, piracy is no fun. ;(
* Jailbreak is failing first try? -- You need WiFi for initial jailbreak, and therefore cannot use Airplane Mode. This is due to licensing on Cydia Substrate.
