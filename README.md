**This fork requires a network connection to jailbreak.**
## Changes from unc0ver
* APT 1.7
* New true black UI designed by [CodeRedKillah](https://twitter.com/coderedkillah) (This will ship at a later date.)
* Substrate is downloaded from the Internet
* Sileo support via [Diatrus](https://github.com/Diatrus)

## Switching from the other jailbreaks
* The RootFS will automatically be restored
* Users of unc0ver will not have to restore rootfs
* If you use Diatrus's Sileo Installer on regular unc0ver, you will need to run `removesileo` in the terminal before using unc0ver dark's version of Sileo.
## Getting support
* Use the built-in diagnostics tool
* Join the u0 Dark [Discord](https://discord.gg/4pYwBCb)
* Join the Jailbreak [Discord](https://discord.gg/jb)
* r/jailbreak on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak)

## Best practices
* Perform a full restore with Rollectra before switching from the other jailbreaks
* Turn off Siri before starting the jailbreak

* This project is completely open source and it will be kept like it in the future
* Any kind of contribution is welcome
